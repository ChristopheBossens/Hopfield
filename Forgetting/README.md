# Hopfield

The Hopfield network is a classical recurrent artificial neural network that is able to store different patterns. This model has been analysed extensively, and extensions to the model have been developed that allow it to cope with low-activity patterns, improve its memory capacity, capture the central tendency of a distribution of patterns and forgetting of old patterns in favor of recollecting new patterns. Additionally, it has been used as a model for human explicit memory and has been used as a basis to model the deterioration that occurs in human hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease.

In this repository I will collect code for simulations that relate to several research papers on Hopfield neural networks. To this end, I have developed a general purpose Hopfield model class in Matlab that easily allows to change different parameters of the model and I have used this class to replicate the results of several papers. My hope is that by collecting these different modifications and extensions can provide a starting point for future research and simulation studies.

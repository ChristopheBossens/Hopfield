# 'Unlearning' has a stabilizing effect in collective memories

This paper shows how after initial pattern acquisition, unlearning affects the accessibility of the patterns. I replicated the effect on the accessibility of spurious patterns (which decreases as a function of unlearning) and original memory patterns (which increases as a function of unlearning). The paper also reports that for original memory patterns the unlearning procedure should equalize the accessibility of these patterns. I could not consistently replicate this effect, which suggest that this might not generally be the case. The effect of unlearning might also interact with the correlation structure of the trained patterns

Open questions for exploration:
- How does unlearning interact with the correlation structure of the trained pattern
- Does the effect of unlearning interact with the pattern load of the network
- Is there an optimal epsilon value for unlearning
- Does the method also work for low activity patterns 
- Can the method be applied for networks that are trained with the perceptron rule

# Low activity patterns
Hopfield networks are typically introduced using patterns in which approximately half of the units are active. If the Hopfield network is taken as a model for an actual brain, this property typically does not respond to biological reality. Here, it is often found that different cortical areas can exhibit sparse activation patterns. The question then becomes if we can construct Hopfield networks that can also store sparse activity patterns. This is possible, but in order to do this the pattern values need to be adjusted.

At the same time, the input threshold of each neuron needs to be modified.
